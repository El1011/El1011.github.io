                    People first listened to music live off the streets and in theaters. Then, Thomas Edison invented the Phonograph which allowed for recording and playing music. Eventually, records flooded the market facilitating mass production and distribution of music. Soon after, the 70’s came along and with it, the cassette; CD’s quickly followed. When the world reached the 21st century, music hit the digital market with online stores and mp3 players that would forever change how people listen to and purchase music. These days, everyone listens to and buys music over the internet. With platforms such as iTunes, Spotify, SoundCloud, and Pandora making waves across the network, anyone can access music. Not only can people sit and enjoy songs from anywhere, but people now have the ability to create their own tracks that they can instantly share with anyone. In the past, one needed a full production studio and the help of a whole team or label to see more than just friends or family listening to their work. Now, anyone can become famous and invent a name for themselves in the music industry from their bedroom on a laptop. Music production has grown from being a hobby to a potential full-time job. However, although the industry has grown, many artists, especially smaller independent ones, have struggled to make ends meet financially. How can an artist with thousands upon thousands of plays on their music across various digital platforms fail to break minimum wage? Although streaming services provide artists with a platform for sharing their music, these services damage the music industry because of their low payouts for artists and difficulty of artist recognition.

                   Streaming services fail artists and the entire music industry by not adequately compensating artists for their work. One of the biggest critiques of today’s current streaming platforms is the abysmally low pay per track play. Daniel Sanchez writes in his article, Streaming Music Royalties are Even Worse Than We Thought – At Least According to This Indie Label, about the poor payouts on various music streaming sites reported by various websites, artists, and independent (indie) labels. He lists out different platforms and their payouts: “Napster, the king of streaming music payouts, now pays out $0.019 per stream . . . TIDAL . . . $0.0125 per stream . . . Apple Music now pays $0.00735 . . . YouTube . . . pays artists $0.00069” (Sanchez). These poor payouts make everyday life for indie artists a struggle as they worry more about budgeting to make the month’s rent than making good quality music. By comparing the payout per stream to the US minimum wage per month (~$1400), Sanchez estimates that an artist would need anywhere from 77,000 plays on Napster to over 2 million plays on YouTube to even reach those margins. Although artists receive inadequate payment, streaming is the only reliable method to get one’s music heard in this day and age. In Sam Davies’ article, Creators Must Be Paid For Their Art: What Needs To Happen?, he talks about some of the profound problems that plague artist in today’s world. Davies writes about what a producer’s income looks like today. “Physical sales . . . represent just 6% of album listens in a contemporary electronic music . . . digital downloads . . . making up around 16% of track and album listens combined . . . streaming, which makes up about 79% of listening” (Davies). Streaming has become a massive part of an artist’s plays, yet their returns for any amount of them are so little that they fly away like the airwaves their sounds on which they are carried. Even being signed onto a label offers little financial security unless you’re already a well-established artists. After interviewing Sam Barker, producer and head of an respected label, Davies writes, “artists can’t expect much when signing to his label. ‘Really what we offer is not financial . . . it’s more just “do you wanna put a record out . . . ?” The expectation is that you might break even’” (Davies). Labels are starting to fade away and are no longer viable to an artist seeking to produce music as a career. The returns from a signing and release are next to none and even the heads of labels are starting to notice.

                    It is often pointed out that these massive streaming platforms pave way for indie artists to launch their careers. The freedom and opportunities that artists can choose from today are much greater than before—where one needed a record deal and booking agent to be acknowledged. In Peter Robinson’s article, Streams ahead: the artists who made it huge without radio support, he offers examples of newcomers who entered the world of mainstream media and became immediate sensations. Robinson mentions artists who have exploded in popularity through streaming such as, “Kiiara . . . 312m [million] streams on Spotify alone . . . Joel Adams, whose one and only song Please Don’t Go has chalked up 320m streams on Spotify . . . Lukas Graham . . . the artist Starley . . . ‘put the record out and, before you know it, the song’s raising its head. It’s performing on Spotify faster and better than any record of the last year. She was unknown a couple of months ago.’ . . . 220m streams . . . over $1m” (Robinson). The power to gather hundreds of millions of streams grants relatively unknown artists the possibility of being picked up by labels, radio stations, and publications. This landslide effect enables them to obtain more fans, fame, and fortune.

                     	Though some artists have been able to profit and thrive in the streaming world, starting from the ground up and struggling to attract a crowd is more demanding than before. The internet’s accessibility make it easy for anyone to create and upload their own music, leading to an oversaturation of streaming platforms. There is so much music being produced to a point where there are websites, such as Forgotify, dedicated to the millions of songs that have never or seldom been played. Additionally, big name labels also play into the mix of artist failing to be acknowledged. 
                        In an article by Lily Oberman, she writes about the struggles that current indie artists face in the music industry. Due to the monetary risk of signing new acts, influential labels have remained focus on already-popular or trending artists instead of venturing into the development of promising new ones. Oberman quotes Taylor Swift who laments, “‘artists will get record deals because they have fans, not the other way around’ . . . independent artists . . . [have] to promote their music on their own in order to garner enough fans to get the attention of the bigger players in the industry so they can have fans who pay them nothing” (Oberman). Labels only set their sights on already known or popular artists gatekeeping those unknown from accruing success themselves. As a result, an artist’s value to their superiors is their ability to draw a crowd and build a fanbase, not just the quality of their music. Before the possibility of being signed to a label, small artists are expected to pay everything from booking shows to transportation on top of already paying for their rent and food, often seeing little to no return because revenue from streams and small labels are still staggeringly insignificant.

                    	The inadequacy of streaming services to pay artists and the arduous struggle for artists to gain enough fans to be validated has impaired the music industry and its artists. Streaming services, like Spotify, need to allow for music to be profitable by compensating the creators that put content onto their platform to begin with. While platforms like Spotify and Pandora aren’t disappearing anytime soon, artists and listeners alike should be more aware of services like Bandcamp, which allows people to stream freely, but also be able to purchase tracks (physical and digital) or products from creators directly, and gives the artists themselves full control of their page and promotion. Additionally, Bandcamp takes a significantly smaller cut of each sale than most other digital media stores. Listeners need to be more conscientious of the source their entertainment and how to support the artists they listen to in a mutually beneficial way.

                        <p>
                            Being an independent musician was hard even before the coronavirus brought the world to a halt. With venues being shut down, tours cancelled, and releases postponed, the ongoing pandemic has shaken up the music industry as a whole, and independent artists are among those whose livelihoods are most threatened by the global crisis. To understand the different ways in which the COVID-19 outbreak has affected artists, we reached out to a number of musicians and asked them how quarantine has impacted their day-to-day lives, as well as their thoughts on how the current situation will shape the music landscape in the future.

                            Formed in 2007 by internet entrepreneurs Shawn Grunberger and Ethan Diamond, Bandcamp has taken on little outside investment during nearly a decade of steady growth and profitability. “It is such a slowburn and looked old compared with streaming for a long time — now it suddenly looks like the model of the future,” says Keith Jopling, consulting director at UK technology research group MIDiA.

                            Kanye West released a surprise track honoring his late mother, Donda West, on what would’ve been her 71st birthday, July 12. West tweeted the track on Sunday, along with a music video comprised of various clips. “Donda” actually starts off with a snippet of her quoting KRS-One’s “Sound of da Police.”

                            Yesterday, the artist MYLK posted an accusation of sexual assault by Aero Chord from an incident in 2014. The accusation recounts when Aero Chord flew to visit MYLK at her home in London and made repeated unwanted advances on her after multiple and clear responses of “no.”
                            
                            Tiffany Nonaka posted her own yesterday, and followed up with a full recount of her experiences. The first time was when she was 19. The second time was at the age of 22, at the hands of Christian Mochizuki, aka graves.

                            Since the concert industry shut down in mid-March, the livestream has become ubiquitous. Diplo performed from his dimly lit living room floor. John Legend took requests on Instagram Live in his bathrobe. Keith Urban played in his warehouse with his wife, Nicole Kidman, dancing in and out of the frame.

Audius  wants to be the opposite, and offer a new home for artists where they’ll eventually earn 90% of revenue earned and the startup itself can’t remove songs.
