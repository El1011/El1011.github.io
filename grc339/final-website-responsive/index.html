                        <h3>Spotify makes billions while artists scrape pennies</h3>
                        <p>People first listened to music live off the streets and in theaters. Then, Thomas Edison invented the Phonograph which allowed for recording and playing music. Eventually, records flooded the market facilitating mass production and distribution of music. Soon after, the 70’s came along and with it, the cassette; CD’s quickly followed. When the world reached the 21st century, music hit the digital market with online stores and mp3 players that would forever change how people listen to and purchase music. These days, everyone listens to and buys music over the internet. With platforms such as iTunes, Spotify, SoundCloud, and Pandora making waves across the network, anyone can access music. Not only can people sit and enjoy songs from anywhere, but people now have the ability to create their own tracks that they can instantly share with anyone. In the past, one needed a full production studio and the help of a whole team or label to see more than just friends or family listening to their work. Now, anyone can become famous and invent a name for themselves in the music industry from their bedroom on a laptop. Music production has grown from being a hobby to a potential full-time job. However, although the industry has grown, many artists, especially smaller independent ones, have struggled to make ends meet financially. How can an artist with thousands upon thousands of plays on their music across various digital platforms fail to break minimum wage? Although streaming services provide artists with a platform for sharing their music, these services damage the music industry because of their low payouts for artists and difficulty of artist recognition.

                        <h3>Covid's impact on independent artists</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being an independent musician was hard even before the coronavirus brought the world to a halt. With venues being shut down, tours cancelled, and releases postponed, the ongoing pandemic has shaken up the music industry as a whole, and independent artists are among those whose livelihoods are most threatened by the global crisis. To understand the different ways in which the COVID-19 outbreak has affected artists, we reached out to a number of musicians and asked them how quarantine has impacted their day-to-day lives, as well as their thoughts on how the current situation will shape the music landscape in the future.

                        <p>
                            Formed in 2007 by internet entrepreneurs Shawn Grunberger and Ethan Diamond, Bandcamp has taken on little outside investment during nearly a decade of steady growth and profitability. “It is such a slowburn and looked old compared with streaming for a long time — now it suddenly looks like the model of the future,” says Keith Jopling, consulting director at UK technology research group MIDiA.

                            Kanye West released a surprise track honoring his late mother, Donda West, on what would’ve been her 71st birthday, July 12. West tweeted the track on Sunday, along with a music video comprised of various clips. “Donda” actually starts off with a snippet of her quoting KRS-One’s “Sound of da Police.”

                        <p>
                            Yesterday, the artist MYLK posted an accusation of sexual assault by Aero Chord from an incident in 2014. The accusation recounts when Aero Chord flew to visit MYLK at her home in London and made repeated unwanted advances on her after multiple and clear responses of “no.”
                            
                            Tiffany Nonaka posted her own yesterday, and followed up with a full recount of her experiences. The first time was when she was 19. The second time was at the age of 22, at the hands of Christian Mochizuki, aka graves.

                            Since the concert industry shut down in mid-March, the livestream has become ubiquitous. Diplo performed from his dimly lit living room floor. John Legend took requests on Instagram Live in his bathrobe. Keith Urban played in his warehouse with his wife, Nicole Kidman, dancing in and out of the frame.

                        <h3>Audius: the SoundCloud killer</h3>
                        <p>
                            Plenty of musicians and fans are sick of SoundCloud’s  expensive hosting costs, haphazard content takedowns and lagging user experience as the site’s status withers. Audius  wants to be the opposite, and offer a new home for artists where they’ll eventually earn 90% of revenue earned and the startup itself can’t remove songs.
