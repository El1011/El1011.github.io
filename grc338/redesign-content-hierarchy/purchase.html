            <h2>Warranties</h2>
            <p>It is important to note that Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc, manufactures very little of what we sell. Warranties are between you the purchaser and the manufacture of the products you purchase. We will do everything we can to assist you in any and all warranty claims including repair/replacement. But the process by which any warranty situation is handled is determined by the manufacture and not Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. Also, we DO NOT provide any assistance with warranty issues arising on merchandise which was sold and/or taken outside of the United States. In these situations, we will provide contact information for the manufacture and nothing more! In any case, all freight charges arising from returns, exchanges, service or anything else is the sole responsibility of the purchaser.</p>

            <h2>Cancellations/Returns</h2>
            <p>Due to the nature of our products, changes or cancellations to an order can only be accepted the day the order is placed, and may require written notice of such action. However, "rush" or same day shipping of an item per the customers request, is an exception to this policy, and NO changes or cancellations are accepted.</p>
            <p>Any "authorized" product return is subject to a restocking fee! This amount will range from 20% to as much as 50%, depending on the manufactures policies. In addition, the customer is responsible for all freight charges in both directions. Returned products MUST be in new condition with all shipping cartons/manuals/packaging in place, and be accompanied by a "return authorization" number. If not, additional charges may be assessed, and/or the return may be rejected. In the event we are forced to reject your return, you will be responsible for the freight charges to return the product back to you once again.</p>
            <p>Many of the items we sell are special order or custom manufactured to your specifications. Examples of this are the lead markers and lead aprons. All such products are NOT returnable! It is your responsibility to ask before ordering a product from us, if that particular item is a "special order" item, and therefore will not be returnable later on if you wish to do so. No returns, which are "authorized", will be accepted after 30 days from the shipment date of your product.</p>

            <h2>Refusal of Shipment</h2>
            <p>If for any reason a buyer decides to refuse delivery of ordered goods. Return shipping charges and re-stocking fees will be withheld from any monies that would be credited back to the buyer. And in the case of "customized" items such as markers with initials, lead garments that have been either monogrammed or made to customers specification, no refund will be issued at all. Pacific Northwest X-Ray highly recommends to international customers that they contact a customs broker in their area and find out before ordering what duties and taxes may be, as we have no control over those fees, and they are the responsibility of the buyer. Also, be aware that some freight carriers charge a brokerage fee on top of the duty and taxes.</p>

            <h2>Delivery, setup and usage of purchased products.</h2>
            <p>Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. is a retailer of radiology and other medical products to the general public. We sell products to you, delivered with a variety of shipping methods. Normally, on large items this will require you to have a freight dock or forklift. We can arrange for inside delivery to customers who do not have a freight dock or forklift. However, it is the buyers responsibility to discuss any special delivery requirements with your Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. sales representative at the time of order. It is also the buyers responsibility to note any and all damages to the shipping container, i.e. boxes, before signing and accepting your shipment. Otherwise, there may be little if anything we can do to assist in repairing or obtaining a replacement.</p>
            <p>Many products such as lead apparel require no special assistance to setup and use them. Other items, such as film processors, do require some assembly, setup and technical know-how to make use of them. But in no way do we offer services to help the customer un-crate, assemble or otherwise make use of the products purchased from us. Often times you can find local professionals in your area to assist you in this. We suggest consulting your local yellow pages under "X-Ray Service". But this is the buyers responsibility to acquire and pay for said services. Finally, some items, such as x-ray generators, require certain licenses from several different government entities. This also is the buyers responsibility. Usage of x-ray equipment on live humans without the proper credentials and/or licenses is a serious crime in many countries. By purchasing such products, you are representing to us that you have, or intend to acquire before usage, any and all legal requirements to use said products in your jurisdiction and that you are fully qualified to do so. Further, you agree to fully indemnify and hold blameless Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. against any and all liability arising out of the usage of any products purchased from us at any time.</p>
