                    <h2>Up to Date Information</h2>
                    <p>Products are being added to the site frequently. Others are taken off because they become obsolete or discontinued for various other reasons. Changes are being made to this site every single day!</p>

                    <h2>Better Information</h2>
                    <p>Larger cleaner graphics, more detailed product specifications, those are the hallmarks of pnwx.com. We provide you with more Name Brand product choices with more complete product information. Our data entry staff are working from different parts of the country inputting the most up to date information that the manufacturers provide. When discrepancies are found, they are updated immediately by our data entry personnel. When customers call asking questions and/or requesting information that was not previously available and accessible on the website - we research the answers for that customer and add that information to the website right away! That way you are assured the most complete product information available!</p>

                    <h2>In House Website Hosting</h2>
                    <p>pnwx.com is its own Internet Service Provider. We also provide co-location and web serving for other businesses both in and out of the Radiology Community. Our own servers sit on racks in our climate controlled network room right here in our head office in the East Portland Oregon Metro Area. All systems are UPS power protected, with the UPS systems backed up by auto-starting and transferring generation systems. This allows us to be 100% in control of our site and keep it up and running with excellence! It also keeps us from being limited to a certain sized site - or being forced to use web authoring programs like Front Page, as so many other sites are hosted in the Radiology industry. If we need additional server power or features, we just slide another server into our racks and it's ready to serve. Furthermore, we are not forced to use a seriously overloaded server at some bulk hosting company that also hosts adult and other questionable sites that are then filtered or blocked by a lot of ISP's to protect their customers from the objectional content. Without all these problems, our sites remain fast, responsive and available to you, our customers, 24/7 for all your needs, at any time that is the most convenient!</p>

                    <h2>Pricing</h2>
                    <p>Because of our large quantities we purchase, we are able to negotiate lower pricing on many items we market. We pass these savings on to you. Many of our customers find that we can offer them a better value than their small local dealer can offer. In addition, all products that we can price, are priced and posted on our website. If the product you are looking at does not show a price, it means that manufacturer has asked us not to price it on the site. You will need to contact the sales department for your price. Our pricing is kept in databases and is updated as soon as we receive information about any changes from manufacturers.</p>
